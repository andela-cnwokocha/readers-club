#Readers Book club

### Introduction :books:

In a given readers club, books are distributed to members (Students or Staffs) based on the rank of the requester or the date of registration of the requester. The following conditions applies before a member gets a book;  

> ###### If a Staff and a Student both request for the same book at the same time, the Staff gets the book.  
> ###### If two Staffs request for the same book at the same time, the older Staff (one with an older date of registration)    gets access to the book.  
> ###### If two Students place request for the same book at the same time, the Student who joined the club earlier gets the    book.  

This project implements classes that defines properties, and behaviors of the club and its members.
